# ProjektSO
A WPF application to simulate the random movement of cars across two lanes of traffic and a train that crosses the road - if a train is coming then the cars at the barrier are supposed to stop. Through the creation of this simulation, I became familiar with how threads work in C#, how they work, how to put them to sleep and how to synchronize them.
